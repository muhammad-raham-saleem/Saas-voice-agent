TechFlow API Documentation
============================

Overview
--------
The TechFlow REST API allows you to programmatically interact with your TechFlow workspace. The API follows RESTful conventions and returns JSON responses. API access is available on Pro and Enterprise plans. The base URL for all API requests is: https://api.techflow.io/v1

Authentication
--------------
All API requests require authentication using an API key. You can generate an API key in Settings > API > Generate Key. Include your API key in the request header:

Authorization: Bearer tf_your_api_key_here

API keys are scoped to your user account and inherit your permissions. You can create multiple API keys with different scopes (read-only, read-write, admin). API keys can be revoked at any time in Settings > API > Manage Keys. Never share your API key or commit it to version control. If you suspect your API key has been compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.

Rate Limits
-----------
API rate limits vary by plan:
- Pro plan: 1,000 requests per hour per API key
- Enterprise plan: 10,000 requests per hour per API key
Rate limit headers are included in every response:
- X-RateLimit-Limit: Maximum requests per hour
- X-RateLimit-Remaining: Requests remaining in current window
- X-RateLimit-Reset: Unix timestamp when the rate limit resets
When you exceed the rate limit, the API returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests). Implement exponential backoff in your integration to handle rate limiting gracefully. If you need higher rate limits, contact sales@techflow.io.
