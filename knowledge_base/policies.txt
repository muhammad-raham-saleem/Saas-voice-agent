TechFlow Company Policies
===========================

Data Privacy Policy
-------------------
TechFlow is committed to protecting your data and privacy. We comply with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), and other applicable data protection laws.

DATA COLLECTION:
We collect only the data necessary to provide our services. This includes:
- Account information: name, email address, company name, billing address
- Usage data: login times, features used, pages visited (anonymized analytics)
- Content data: tasks, projects, comments, and files you create within TechFlow
- Payment information: processed and stored securely by Stripe (we never store full credit card numbers)

DATA STORAGE:
All customer data is stored on Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure in the US-East-1 (Virginia) region by default. Enterprise customers can choose from additional regions: EU-West-1 (Ireland), AP-Southeast-1 (Singapore), or US-West-2 (Oregon). Data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption and in transit using TLS 1.3. Database backups are performed every 6 hours and retained for 30 days.

DATA RETENTION:
Active account data is retained for the duration of your subscription. When you delete a task, project, or file, it is moved to trash and permanently deleted after 30 days. When you cancel your account, all your data is permanently deleted within 90 days. You can request immediate data deletion by contacting privacy@techflow.io. We retain anonymized usage analytics for up to 2 years for product improvement purposes.

DATA ACCESS:
TechFlow employees access customer data only when necessary to provide support (with your explicit permission) or to comply with legal obligations. All data access by employees is logged and audited. We conduct annual third-party security audits. We will never sell your data to third parties. Data is shared with third-party processors only as necessary to provide our services (e.g., email delivery, payment processing) and these processors are bound by data processing agreements.

DATA PORTABILITY:
You can export all your data at any time using the export feature in Settings > Account > Export Data. Exports include all tasks, projects, comments, time entries, and attachments in JSON and CSV formats. Enterprise customers can use the API for bulk data export.

YOUR RIGHTS:
Under GDPR and CCPA, you have the right to:
- Access your personal data
- Correct inaccurate data
- Delete your data ("right to be forgotten")
- Export your data (data portability)
- Object to data processing
- Restrict data processing
To exercise any of these rights, contact privacy@techflow.io.

When an incident occurs:
1. We acknowledge the issue within 15 minutes (Enterprise) or 1 hour (Pro)

To request a refund, contact support@techflow.io within 30 days of your initial payment with the subject line "Refund Request" and include your account email and reason for cancellation. Refunds are processed within 5-10 business days to the original payment method. After the 30-day period, no refunds are issued for monthly plans. Annual plan customers may cancel at any time, but service continues until the end of the prepaid period with no partial refund. Enterprise customers should refer to their individual contract terms for refund and cancellation policies.
