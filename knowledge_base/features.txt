TechFlow Product Features Guide
================================

Overview
--------
TechFlow is a comprehensive project management platform designed for modern teams. Whether you're a startup or an enterprise, TechFlow provides the tools you need to plan, track, and deliver projects on time. Our platform supports Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall methodologies out of the box.

Kanban Boards
-------------
TechFlow's Kanban boards give your team a visual workflow management system. You can create unlimited boards with customizable columns such as To Do, In Progress, Review, and Done. Each card supports rich text descriptions, file attachments (up to 50MB per file), checklists, due dates, priority labels (Critical, High, Medium, Low), and custom tags. Cards can be assigned to one or more team members. You can drag and drop cards between columns and set WIP (Work In Progress) limits on any column to prevent bottlenecks. Kanban boards also support swimlanes, allowing you to group tasks by team member, priority, or any custom field. Board templates are available for software development, marketing campaigns, HR onboarding, and more.

Time Tracking
-------------
Built-in time tracking lets team members log hours directly on tasks. You can start and stop a timer with a single click or manually enter time entries. TechFlow generates detailed time reports broken down by project, team member, date range, and task category. Time tracking integrates with our billing module, so you can easily generate invoices for client-facing projects. Weekly timesheet views allow managers to review and approve hours. Time tracking supports rounding rules (nearest 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or exact). Export time reports in CSV, PDF, or Excel format. The time tracking dashboard shows trends, averages, and utilization rates across your team.

Team Collaboration
------------------
TechFlow includes powerful collaboration features to keep your team connected. Real-time comments and @mentions notify team members instantly via in-app notifications, email, or Slack. Threaded discussions keep conversations organized within each task. Shared document editing allows multiple team members to work on project documents simultaneously with version history and change tracking. Team dashboards show activity feeds, upcoming deadlines, and workload distribution. You can create team channels for project-specific communication. File sharing supports drag-and-drop uploads with automatic virus scanning. Guest access allows external collaborators to view and comment on specific projects without full account access.

Security Features
